- Single Responsibility Principle
    A class should have only one reason or purpose to serve. It means the class should have only one responsibility.

- Open-Close Principle
    Instances should be open for extension but close for modification. This mean instances (classes,functions,modules or etc.,) can be extendable by another instance but shouldn't allow direct modification to them.

- Liskov Substitution Principle
    This mean that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

- Interface Segregation Principle
    We shouldn't force the instances to implement the interfaces that they don't use. We should make the interface flexible for most cases.

- Dependency Inversion Principle
    This principle aims to decouple high-level modules (which provide complex functionality) from low-level modules (which provide basic functionality) by introducing an abstraction layer between them. This allows both high-level and low-level modules to depend on abstractions rather than on solid implementations, making the system more flexible, extensible, and maintainable.
