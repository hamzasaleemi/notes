Git:
Git is a Version Control System. It is a tool that helps to track changes in code.

Untracked Files:
Files that are not tracked by git and are new.

Staged:
Files that are ready to be commit.

Pull Request:
Request to merge code from 1 branch to another. It can include reviewer to approve the code.

Merge Conflict:
An event when github is unable to resolve differences in code.

Fork:
Fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original upstream repository. It is a rough copy of repository.

Configure Commands:
git config --global user.name "Name"
git config --global user.email "Email"
git config --list

Initialize Commands:
1. git clone <link>: Clone a repository on the local machine.
2. git init: Create new git repository.
3. git remote add origin <link>: Add remote orgin to new repository.
4. git remote -v: Check remote.

Branch Commands:
1. git branch: Check branch.
2. git branch -M <name>: Change branch name.
3. git checkout <branch>: Change branch.
4. git branch -b <name>: Create new branch.
5. git branch -d <name>: Delete a branch. Cannot delete current branch.

Code Push Commands:
1. git status: Display state of the code.
2. git add <files>: Add new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.
3. git commit -m "Message": It is the record of change.
4. git push origin <branch>: Upload local repository content to remote repository. Use -u to set origin branch as default so we can only use git push.

Merge Commands:
1. git diff <branch>: Difference of current branch with the given branch.
2. git merge <branch>: Merge branch in current branch.
3. git pull origin <branch>: Get code from remote branch.

Undo Commands:
1. git reset <file>: Unstage a staged file. Use --hard to also remove unstaged changes and have a clean repository.
2. git reset: Unstage all staged files.
3. git reset HEAD~<count>: Go back in commits stack count times. Like if you commited something which you want to remove then use git reset HEAD~1 to undo commit. You will still have the changes as unstaged files.
4. git log: Check previous commits.
5. git reset <commit hash>: Go back to a specific commit.
