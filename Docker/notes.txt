Container:
Executable Package that bundles an application and its dependencies. It is runnable instance of Docker Image.

Image:
A Docker image is a read-only template containing instructions for creating a Docker container. It essentially serves as a blueprint or a snapshot of an application and its entire environment.

Setup:
1. Install Docker
2. Install WSL

DockerHub:
Same as github. It is used to create repositories for Docker Images.

Commands:
1. docker pull [Image Name]
    This command will get the docker image locally if not present from docker hub. Can be pull different version by adding version to image name like image:version
2. docker images
    This command will list all local images.
3. docker run -it [Image Name]
    This will run the image file and create a container and execute it.
    -it: interactive parameter we will be able to access the container commandline.
    --name [Name]: name of the new container
    -d: run container in detached mode
    -p HOSTPORT:CONTAINERPORT: Port mapping of host to container.
    --network [Network Name]: Assign a docker network. 
4. docker ps -a
    List all containers.
5. docker start [Container Name or ID]
    Start the container.
6. docker stop [Container Name or ID]
    Stop the container.
7. docker rmi [Image Name or ID]
    Delete the docker image.
8. docker rm [Container Name or ID]
    Delete the docker container.
9. docker logs [Container Name or ID]
    Print logs of container.
10. docker exec -it [Container Name or ID] /bin/bash
    Execute command in container.

Docker VS Virtual Machine
1. Docker only uses application layer but VM also uses OS Host Kernal Layer.

Docker Network:
    A network for containers to interacte with each other.

Commands:
1. docker network ls
    List all networks
2. docker network create [Network Name]
    Create a new network.

Docker Compose:
A tool for defining and running multi-container applications. We write all docker commands in yaml(yet another markup language) file and then run it to handle multiple containers.

Commands:
1. docker compose -f [File Name].yaml up -d
    Run all docker commands and create images and containers and execute them.
2. docker compose -f [File Name].yaml down
    Delete all related images and containers.
